# Deep-Learning-from-Scratch
This projects consists of two assignments which includes implementation of Deep Learning concepts like Gradient Descent, KNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully Connected Neural Network, CNN from scractch.

## Assignment 1:

This includes the non-vecotorized and vctorized implementation of Gradient Descent Forward pass & Backward pass, KKN, SVM, Softmax and Two layered fully connected neural network from scratch using Numpy.

## Assignment 2:

This includes the implementation of Fully connected networks, CNN, Different types of Normalization, and Dropout from scratch using Numpy as well as using DL libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow.
